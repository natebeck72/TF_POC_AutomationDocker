# TF_POC_AutomationDocker
This is the Terraform Plan for the Automation Docker Container

This terraform plan is part of the terraform_ansible docker container that can be used to deploy infrastructure for use in a SASE POC.

There are some things that are commented out as most folks will not have access to the AWS route53 zone that hosts our DNS records.

Please see the GitHub repo for the docker container for how this is used.
